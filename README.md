# CodexInterns Internship Tasks 🚀

This repository contains my internship work completed at CodexInterns, focusing on Machine Learning, Python Programming, and Web Development.I choose domain Python development.

# 📌 Tasks Overview
1️⃣ House Price Prediction using Linear Regression 🏠

Description:
Developed a Linear Regression model to predict house prices using features such as number of rooms, size, location, and other relevant factors.

Steps Implemented:

Collected and preprocessed dataset (from Kaggle).

Handled missing values, performed feature encoding, and scaling.

Trained and evaluated a Linear Regression model using Scikit-learn.

Evaluated model with R² Score & Mean Squared Error (MSE).

Tech Stack: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Jupyter Notebook.

Description:
Built a Python tool using NumPy to perform various matrix operations with an interactive interface.

Features Implemented:

Matrix Addition

Matrix Subtraction

Matrix Multiplication

Matrix Transpose

Determinant Calculation

Tech Stack: Python, NumPy, Jupyter Notebook

# 3️⃣ Sentiment Analysis Web Application 💬

- Description: Created a Sentiment Analysis Web App that classifies user-entered text as Positive, Negative, or Neutral and shows Polarity & Subjectivity scores.
- Features:

-> Text input area for user text
-> Sentiment classification (positive, negative, neutral)
-> Displays Polarity (-1 to +1) and Subjectivity (0 to 1)
-> Interactive UI with styled results and example test cases
-> Tech Stack: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, (Flask/TextBlob backend support planned)
